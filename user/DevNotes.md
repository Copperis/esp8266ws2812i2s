# WebUI Improvement

## Range

Somehow include magic bit-sequence, i.e. `#000001` to preserve color in `ws2812_push()`.

## Pattern

Make a custom command to have the esp8266 use the patterns in `wsend` autonomously.
Propapbly requires a timer.
Patterns should be shared.
Maybe a new file with the switch-staement from `wsend`?
